title: An intro to this new blog&#58; What have changed ?

Almost a year, i tried to get myself involved in blogging community. It
was not as good as i expected.

When i started, i was not prepared, i did not have any content, i was not
experienced and did not have some kind of minimal knowledge in domains i wanted
to talk about: System administration (mainly on Linux, i'm currently not good at
Windows stuffs) and Python development, because these where the stuffs i loved,
a year ago.

## The trigger
Meanwhile, i have been in an internship at [Kozea](http://kozea.fr/ "Kozea")
which has been a great step in my IT Student life, and more ... A great team,
working on great projects. That's it. It gave me more subjects to
talk about, a better technical backend, and a «think about it, first» attitude,
in that, prior, when i was facing a programming or almost any computer science
problem, i used to rush headlong. No need to say it never worked.

## What have changed ?
So, on this 2013 year-end, I come again trying to open a blog. But this time,
it's different. I have content, a better technical backend, some global
knowledge about most of the current technos, in devevelopment as well as in
Linux ecosystem. And, last but not least, i am not going to set myself some
unachievable goals like «Write 1 post per day, all the year». This time is gone
and, anyway, i am not good enough currently to set myself this type of goal.
Maybe one day.

## What i will be talking about.
This has nothing definitive. I will be talking about many stuffs, from technical
to personal (at a certain level), or even raging on something. But, it will be,
mainly, some Linux/Unix posts on technos such as Linux Containers, OpenVZ,
Clusters. On the development level, it could be anything about Python language,
Node.js (that i'm discovering), language learning, learning curves, or personal
projects.

## The Final !
Last stuff, the langage. It can be weird (or not), but i have better writing
skills in english than in french. Weird in that i have been living in two
African countries with french as official language. Then i started University in
France. All French-speaking countries, but i can't write technical stuffs in
french. So, i decided to write in english this time. 

*Excuse me by advance if i write something you, native english speaking person,
could laugh for ...*

Thanks ! And see you soon for some cool thoughts.
